# DIABETES-PREDICTION

AI Based Diabetes Prediction model

INTRODUCTIONS:

Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose
level in a human body. Diabetes should not be ignored if it is
untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person
like: heart related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure,
eye damage and it can also affects other organs of human body.
Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. To achieve
this goal this project work we will do early prediction of Diabetes
in a human body or a patient for a higher accuracy through
applying, Various Machine Learning Techniques. Machine
learning techniques Provide better result for prediction by con-
structing models from datasets collected from patients. In this
work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble
techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes. Which are K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB) and
Random Forest (RF). The accuracy is different for every model
when compared to other models. The Project work gives the
accurate or higher accuracy model shows that the model is capa-
ble of predicting diabetes effectively. Our Result shows that
Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to other
machine learning techniques.

  BRIEF EXPLANATION:
 
This initiative focuses on crafting an artificial intelligence (AI) system dedicated to predicting diabetes. The primary objectives include early detection, tailoring treatment plans, and enhancing overall health outcomes for patients. The system will undergo training using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which encompasses both predictive features and the target variable indicating diabetes status.

The project involves evaluating a variety of machine learning algorithms to pinpoint the most effective model for diabetes prediction. Once the optimal model is identified, it will be deployed for production and integrated into a mobile app. This app aims to empower both patients and caregivers, allowing them to monitor diabetes risk and actively manage the disease.

CONCLUSION:
AI-based diabetes prediction has the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and manage diabetes. AI models can be trained to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, diagnose diabetes early, and assess a patient's risk of complications. This information can be used to develop personalized treatment plans for patients and improve their overall health outcomes.
AI-based diabetes prediction is still in its early stages of development, but it has already made significant progress. AI models have been shown to be accurate in predicting diabetes risk and complications. AI-based diabetes prediction systems are also being deployed in clinical settings to help healthcare professionals diagnose and manage diabetes.
Here are some of the key challenges and opportunities for AI-based diabetes prediction:
Challenges:
•	Data privacy and security: AI-based diabetes prediction systems collect and process sensitive patient data. It is important to ensure that this data is protected from unauthorized access and use.
•	Transparency and accountability: AI-based diabetes prediction systems should be transparent about how they work and how they make decisions. This is important for building trust with patients and caregivers.
•	Equity and inclusion: AI-based diabetes prediction systems should be designed and evaluated in a way that ensures that they are fair and equitable for all patients, regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other factors.
•	Potential for bias: AI models can be biased, depending on the data that they are trained on. It is important to be aware of this potential bias and to take steps to mitigate it.
